We ensure that compliance is built into every aspect of our product development cycle, from design and engineering to deployment and monitoring. Our solutions are developed with a thorough understanding of international data security and privacy laws, including GDPR, HIPAA, and others. We also work closely with legal and regulatory advisors to stay ahead of regulatory changes and ensure that our products continue to meet evolving compliance requirements. This commitment to balancing innovation with compliance is a key differentiator for DAKB Codeworks, ensuring that we can innovate securely and responsibly.</p>

While day-to-day decisions are made by our management team, our investors are regularly informed about key developments and consulted on major strategic decisions, particularly those that impact long-term growth and financial performance. We hold annual general meetings (AGMs) and quarterly updates, where investors can provide valuable feedback, ask questions, and offer insights based on their experience and expertise. Strategic investors, especially those with backgrounds in technology, cybersecurity, or government operations, often contribute to high-level decisions, helping us refine our roadmap and identify new market opportunities. We view our investors as partners and value their input as we grow and evolve.</p>
